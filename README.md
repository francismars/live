## Setup & Development

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (monorepo package manager)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [LNbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits) (for Lightning payments - optional)

### Install dependencies
```sh
pnpm install
```

### Start the development servers
From the monorepo root:
```sh
pnpm run dev      # Start both frontend and backend concurrently
```
- The `dev` script in the root `package.json` uses `concurrently` to run both frontend and backend together for a smooth development workflow.

You can also run them individually:
```sh
pnpm run dev:frontend   # Start frontend only
pnpm run dev:backend    # Start backend only
```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
```sh
LNBITS_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
LNBITS_ADMIN_KEY=your_admin_key_here
LNBITS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
```

### Lint & Format
```sh
pnpm --filter frontend lint
```
